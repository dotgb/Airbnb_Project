# Airbnb_Project

Exploring renting a more expensive apartment in NYC with the hope of offsetting some of the cost with Airbnb listings

## Libraries used

## Project Motivation
I plan on renting an apartment in NYC(Manhattan) that is $3500, I would prefer to leave alone and expect to travel at least one weekend every month. I need to find out using the public airbnb data if it is possible to make at least $500 by posting the apartment on Airbnb on the weekend so my monthly out of pocket rent is $3000.

## Questions I intend to answer in this project
How much do studios in NYC make on weekends?
What areas make the most?
What factors are most influential for pricing?
