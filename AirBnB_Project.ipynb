    "\n",
    "Pose at least three questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Jupyter Notebook, using any associated packages you'd like, to:\n",

    "Prepare data:\n",
    "Gather necessary data to answer your questions\n",
    "Handle categorical and missing data\n",
    "Provide insight into the methods you chose and why you chose them\n",
    "Analyze, Model, and Visualize\n",
    "Provide a clear connection between your business questions and how the data answers them\n",
    "Communicate your business insights:\n",
    "Create a Github repository to share your code and data wrangling/modeling techniques, with a technical audience in mind\n",

    "Your code in a Jupyter notebook, with appropriate comments, analysis, and documentation.\n",
    "You may also provide any other necessary documentation you find necessary.\n",
    "For the blog post, pick a platform of your own choice. For example, it can be on your website, a Medium post (Josh's sample report(opens in a new tab) on How Do YOU Become A Developer?), or a Github blog post. Your blog** **must provide the following:\n",

    "Your questions of interest.\n",
    "Your findings for those questions with a supporting statistic(s), table, or visual.\n",
